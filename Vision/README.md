1. Color Selection Code Example
```
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import matplotlib.image as mpimg
	import numpy as np
	# Read in the image and print out some stats
	image = mpimg.imread('test.jpg')
	print('This image is: ',type(image), 
         'with dimensions:', image.shape)

	# Grab the x and y size and make a copy of the image
	ysize = image.shape[0]
	xsize = image.shape[1]
	# Note: always make a copy rather than simply using "="
	color_select = np.copy(image)
	# Define our color selection criteria
	# Note: if you run this code, you'll find these are not sensible values!!
	# But you'll get a chance to play with them soon in a quiz
	red_threshold = 0
	green_threshold = 0
	blue_threshold = 0
	rgb_threshold = [red_threshold, green_threshold, blue_threshold]
	# Identify pixels below the threshold
	thresholds = (image[:,:,0] < rgb_threshold[0]) \
            | (image[:,:,1] < rgb_threshold[1]) \
            | (image[:,:,2] < rgb_threshold[2])
	Color_select[thresholds] = [0,0,0]

	# Display the image                 
	plt.imshow(color_select)
	plt.show()
```
1. Color Selection
	> Eventually, I found that with red_threshold = green_threshold = blue_threshold = 200, I get a pretty good result, where I can clearly see the lane lines, but most everything else is blacked out.

left_bottom = [0, 539]
right_bottom = [900, 300]
apex = [400, 0]

# Fit lines (y=Ax+B) to identify the  3 sided region of interest
# np.polyfit() returns the coefficients [A, B] of the fit
fit_left = np.polyfit((left_bottom[0], apex[0]), (left_bottom[1], apex[1]), 1)

fit_bottom = np.polyfit((left_bottom[0], right_bottom[0]), (left_bottom[1], right_bottom[1]), 1)

# Find the region inside the lines
XX, YY = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0, xsize), np.arange(0, ysize))
region_thresholds = (YY > (XX*fit_left[0] + fit_left[1])) & \
                    (YY > (XX*fit_right[0] + fit_right[1])) & \
                    (YY < (XX*fit_bottom[0] + fit_bottom[1]))

1. Color and Region Combined
```

# Mask pixels below the threshold

1. Quiz Color Region
	> red_threshold = green_threshold = blue_threshold = 200, I chose the vertices of my triangle to be left_bottom = [0, 539], right_bottom [900, 539], and apex = [475, 320]
1. Finding Lines of Any Color
	> As it happens, lane lines are not always the same color, and even lines of the same color under different lighting conditions (day, night, etc) may fail to be detected by our simple color selection.

	> Note! The standard location of the origin (x=0, y=0) for images is in the top left corner with y values increasing downward and x increasing to the right. This might seem weird at first, but if you think about an image as a matrix, it makes sense that the "00" element is in the upper left.
1. Canny to Detect Lane Lines
```
#doing all the relevant imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Read in the image and convert to grayscale
image = mpimg.imread('exit-ramp.jpg')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)

# Define a kernel size for Gaussian smoothing / blurring
# Note: this step is optional as cv2.Canny() applies a 5x5 Gaussian internally
kernel_size = 3
blur_gray = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray,(kernel_size, kernel_size), 0)

# Define parameters for Canny and run it
# NOTE: if you try running this code you might want to change these!
low_threshold = 1
high_threshold = 10
edges = cv2.Canny(blur_gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)

# Display the image
plt.imshow(edges, cmap='Greys_r')
```
	>As far as a ratio of low_threshold to high_threshold, John Canny himself recommended a low to high ratio of 1:2 or 1:3.
	> The algorithm will first detect strong edge (strong gradient) pixels above the high_threshold, and reject pixels below the low_threshold. Next, pixels with values between the low_threshold and high_threshold will be included as long as they are connected to strong edges. The output edges is a binary image with white pixels tracing out the detected edges and black everywhere else.
1. Quiz: Canny Edges
	> I chose a kernelSize of 5 for Gaussian smoothing, a lowThreshold of 50 and a highThreshold of 150.

1. Hough Transform to Find Lane Lines
	> To do this, we'll be using an OpenCV function called HoughLinesP that takes several parameters. Let's code it up and find the lane lines in the image we detected edges in with the Canny function (for a look at coding up a Hough Transform from scratch, check [this](https://alyssaq.github.io/2014/understanding-hough-transform/) out.) .
	```
	lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(masked_edges, rho, theta, threshold, np.array([]),
                                             min_line_length, max_line_gap)
	```
	```
	# Do relevant imports
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import matplotlib.image as mpimg
	import numpy as np
	import cv2
	# Read in and grayscale the image
	image = mpimg.imread('exit-ramp.jpg')
	gray = cv2.cvtColor(image,cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
	# Define a kernel size and apply Gaussian smoothing
	kernel_size = 5
	blur_gray = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray,(kernel_size, kernel_size),0)
	# Define our parameters for Canny and apply
	low_threshold = 50
	high_threshold = 150
	masked_edges = cv2.Canny(blur_gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)
	# Define the Hough transform parameters
	# Make a blank the same size as our image to draw on
	rho = 1
	theta = np.pi/180
	threshold = 1
	min_line_length = 10
	max_line_gap = 1
	line_image = np.copy(image)*0 #creating a blank to draw lines on
	# Run Hough on edge detected image
	lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(masked_edges, rho, theta, threshold, np.array([]),
	                            min_line_length, max_line_gap)
	# Iterate over the output "lines" and draw lines on the blank
	for line in lines:
	    for x1,y1,x2,y2 in line:
	        cv2.line(line_image,(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(255,0,0),10)
	# Create a "color" binary image to combine with line image
	color_edges = np.dstack((masked_edges, masked_edges, masked_edges)) 
	# Draw the lines on the edge image
	combo = cv2.addWeighted(color_edges, 0.8, line_image, 1, 0) 
	plt.imshow(combo)

	> Here's how I did it: I went with a low_threshold of 50 and high_threshold of 150 for Canny edge detection.

	> For region selection, I defined vertices = np.array([[(0,imshape[0]),(450, 290), (490, 290), (imshape[1],imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)

	> I chose parameters for my Hough space grid to be a rho of 2 pixels and theta of 1 degree (pi/180 radians). I chose a threshold of 15, meaning at least 15 points in image space need to be associated with each line segment. I imposed a min_line_length of 40 pixels, and max_line_gap of 20 pixels
	> correction for rho is 1
